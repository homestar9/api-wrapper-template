# api-wrapper-template
A template for building API clients in CFML

### Acknowledgements

The API wrapper code in this project builds on the API frameworks built by [jcberquist](https://github.com/jcberquist), such as [xero-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/xero-cfml) and [aws-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/aws-cfml). The structure for building the template is based on [cb-module-template](https://github.com/elpete/cb-module-template), by [elpete](https://github.com/elpete).
