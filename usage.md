# api-wrapper-template Usage

Once you've used this tool to scaffold a project, you still need to actually write the API wrapper. The following is a brief guide to the conventions and structure of the API wrapper component generated by this project.

The name of the API you are wrapping is used to generate a `cfc` file, which is the core of the API wrapper component that you're writing. Within that file, you'll need to make some manual adjustments, to ensure the wrapper is configured properly to work with the API. These adjustments primarily have to do with Authentication.

## Authentication

Making sure that authentication is handled correctly is the first step in building your API client. Obviously, if the API has no authentication, you can skip this section.

### Basic Authentication

tldr; *Handled in the `cfhttp` call, using the `username` and `password` variables*

If you've scaffolded your wrapper with the `basic` option, the assumption is that the API requires a `username` and `password`. In actuality, this is not how most APIs function, so you make need to make some changes. By default, the `init()` method for a wrapper using Basic Authentication is structured like this:

```cfc
public any function init(
  string username = '',
  string password = '',
  string baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com/v1',
  boolean includeRaw = false ) {...}
```

The `username` and `password` are then saved in the variables scope, and used for authentication in the `cfhttp` call in the `apiCall()` method:

```cfc
cfhttp( url = fullPath, method = httpMethod, username = variables.username, password = variables.password, result = 'result' ){...}
```

Depending on how the API that you are working with handled Basic Authentication, you should modify these two portions of the wrapper to more effectively handle it.

### API Key Authentication

tldr; *Set in the `getBaseHttpHeaders()` method, using the `apiKey` variable, which is then provided as a header*

For wrappers scaffolded with the `apikey` authentication option, you'll need to modify the wrapper. This is because API providers implement API keys in a range of ways, so there's no simple way to scaffold a wrapper to handle it. By default, the `init()` method for a wrapper using API keys for authentication is structured like this:

```cfc
public any function init(
  string apiKey = '',
  string baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com/v1',
  boolean includeRaw = false ) {...}
```

That API key is then passed as a header in every request to the API, because it is included in the `getBaseHttpHeaders()` method (you can learn a little more about this method [below](#getbasehttpheaders)):

```cfc
private struct function getBaseHttpHeaders() {
  return {
    'Accept' : 'application/json',
    'Content-Type' : 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'Bearer #variables.apiKey#',
    'User-Agent' : 'example/#variables._example_version# (CFML)'
  };
}
```

You will need to adjust the `init()` method and this base HTTP header struct in order to account for the way any particular API handles API keys. That is, if the API requires an `applicationId` and `applicationKey`, you would update the `init()` method to accept them, and then update the `getBaseHttpHeaders()` method to include them, named according to the API's requirements.

If an API doesn't use headers for authentication, you'd need to make more substantial changes in order to include the API key in the URL parameters or request body.

### Environment Variables

In order to separate code from config, API wrappers scaffolded with this project are structured to accept authentication credentials as environment variables. This is done via the `secrets` struct in the `init` method. In instances when you need to provide an API key, it will look like this:

```cfc
var secrets = {
  'apiKey': 'EXAMPLE_API_KEY'
};
```

The value on the right is the name of an environment variable. If it is found, the key on the left will be set equal to its value. So, in the example about, if there were an environment variable named `EXAMPLE_API_KEY` with a value of `abc123!`, when the wrapper is instantiated in your application, it would set `variables.apiKey` equal to `abc123!`, and you would be able to use that for authentication.

**The names of the credentials and environment variables should be updated to suit your needs and the requirements of the API.**
